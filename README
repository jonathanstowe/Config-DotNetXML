README for Config::DotNetXML

Introduction
===========

This module provides a configuration facility similiar to that provided by
the .NET Framework inasmuch as it will read an XML file with the name
of $0.config of the format:

   <configuration>
      <appSettings>
	      <add key="Foo" value="Bar" />
      </appSettings>
   </configuration>

and will by default populate the hash %appSettings with the keys specified
by the <add /> elements.  For more information see the POD documentation.

This may or may not be useful to you as it is limited to a one dimensional
configuration structure - but it was born out of a requirement to share a
configuration between Perl and C# programs.

Prerequisites
=============

This module requires XML::XPath to operate.  This is a change from the initial
release that implemented its own Parser using XML::Parser.

Installation
============

Install the module by executing the following in the directory where you have
unpacked the module distribution:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

You may need to use a different program than make on various different OS.

You will need to run the last step as a user with sufficient permissions to
create files in the Perl library directories - if you require the module to
be installed in an alternative location then you should run the first step as:

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/my/library/directory

You will need to then specify the appropriate location with :

   use lib '/my/library/directory';


BUGS
====

It might be considered a bug that the hash %appSettings will be stomped on.


SUPPORT
=======

All bug reports and patches should be made directly to the author.
